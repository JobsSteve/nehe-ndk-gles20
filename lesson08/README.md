Lesson 8
=========
A quick'n'dirty lesson on blending.

Gotta admit that, despite being a easy one, I expected a easier one. The fragment operations that happen on the pipeline, presently,are still quite clumsy and very "fixey-pipeline". That deserves a proper treatment in newer versions.

This is possibly the last lesson to employ this framework in this form. Next lesson will probably still be based on this, radically changed.
